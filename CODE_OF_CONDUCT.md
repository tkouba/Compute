# Code of Conduct

We are programmers. Intelligent people who know how to treat each other. And we also know that inappropriate behavior has consequences.

## What this means in practice:
- **Respect others** – no personal attacks, harassment, or discrimination.
- **Keep discussions constructive** – criticize code, not people.
- **No spam, trolling, or inappropriate content.**
- **Maintainers may remove inappropriate contributions and block violators.**
